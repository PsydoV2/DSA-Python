## 📚 Overview

The goal of this repository is to document my journey while learning the fundamentals of **algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving in Python**.  
Each notebook focuses on a specific topic — from simple lists and loops to trees, graphs, and sorting algorithms.

All examples are written and executed in **Jupyter Notebooks**, combining code, explanations, and visual outputs.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

- Python basics refresher (variables, loops, functions)
- Big-O notation and time complexity
- Arrays and linked lists
- Stacks and queues
- Searching algorithms (linear, binary)
- Sorting algorithms (bubble, merge, quick)
- Trees and binary search trees
- Graphs, BFS & DFS
- Recursion and dynamic programming
- Problem-solving practice
